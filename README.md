# Powerswitch

Yet another web power switch library for the Digital Loggers Web Power Switch

- It needs to have a cli client and a module to be used by scripts.
- The cli client needs to handle multiple switches through a configuration.
- It needs to handle the rest api of the newer wifi switches.
- It needs to handle the older http only switches. All transparently.
